## Exploring-the-History-of-Lego
In this project, we will analyze a fascinating dataset on every single Lego block that has ever been built.

## Exploratory data analysis
Import data, read the data to get a sense of the diversity of Lego sets, analyze data and make some visualization to get to see the data better.
