## Exploring-the-History-of-Lego
In this mini project, we will analyze a fascinating dataset on every single Lego block that has ever been built.

## Exploratory data analysis
Import data, analyze data and make some visualization to get to see the data better.

## Create topics and get information from the data
play around with the data
- how the average number of parts in Lego sets has varied over the years?
- Lego Themes Over Years
- Get the number of unique themes released in 1999
- What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed? 
- In which year was Star Wars not the most popular licensed theme (in terms of number of sets released that year)?
